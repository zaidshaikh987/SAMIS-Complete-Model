# SAMIS - Smart Agro Market Intelligence System

## Overview

The Smart Agro Market Intelligence System (SAMIS) is a comprehensive solution designed to predict crop prices and analyze agricultural markets. SAMIS integrates various data sources and employs advanced machine learning techniques to provide actionable insights for farmers and stakeholders.

## Project Structure

The SAMIS project is organized into several modules, each responsible for different aspects of the system:

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing**
2. **Sentiment Analysis Module**
3. **Hybrid Forecasting Module**
4. **Graph Neural Networks (GNN) Module**
5. **Self-Reinforcement Learning Module**
6. **Federated Learning Integration**
7. **Neuro-Symbolic AI for Reasoning**
8. **NLP for Localized Farmer Support**
9. **User Interface & Reporting**
10. **Continuous Learning & Adaptation**
11. **Additional Utilities**

## Modules

### 1. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing

This module handles the collection, cleaning, normalization, and splitting of data for further analysis.

**File**: `src/preprocessing/data_preprocessing.py`

### 2. Sentiment Analysis Module

Performs sentiment analysis on news and social media data to assess market sentiments.

**File**: `src/sentiment_analysis/sentiment_analysis.py`

### 3. Hybrid Forecasting Module

Uses Prophet for initial forecasts and refines them with Transformer/LSTM models.

**File**: `src/hybrid_forecasting/hybrid_forecasting.py`

### 4. Graph Neural Networks (GNN) Module

Employs GNNs to learn spatial-temporal correlations between different regions and markets.

**File**: `src/gnn/graph_neural_networks.py`

### 5. Self-Reinforcement Learning Module

Implements reinforcement learning algorithms to continually improve prediction accuracy.

**File**: `src/reinforcement_learning/self_reinforcement_learning.py`

### 6. Federated Learning Integration

Facilitates the aggregation of locally trained models to enhance the global model.

**File**: `src/federated_learning/federated_learning.py`

### 7. Neuro-Symbolic AI for Reasoning

Integrates symbolic reasoning with machine learning models to handle uncertainties.

**File**: `src/neuro_symbolic_ai/neuro_symbolic_ai.py`

### 8. NLP for Localized Farmer Support

Translates model outputs into local languages and provides user interaction via a chatbot or voice assistant.

**File**: `src/nlp/localized_support.py`

### 9. User Interface & Reporting

Provides visualization of predictions and insights through a web-based dashboard or mobile app.

**File**: `src/ui_reporting/ui_reporting.py`

### 10. Continuous Learning & Adaptation

Ensures the model is continuously updated with new data and retrained periodically.

**File**: `src/continuous_learning/continuous_learning.py`

### 11. Additional Utilities

Includes various utility scripts for data scraping and web requests.

**File**: `src/utilities/utilities.py`
